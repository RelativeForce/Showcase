This project is designed to showcase the ability of Joshua Eddy currently
studying Aston University. All the projects in this showcase are extracurricular.

Each package inside /src contains a individual project authored 
almost entirely by Joshua_Eddy. In the case of collaboration the files 
authored by others will have the appropriate documentation. 

1. The packages contained within include;

	1.1 .snake 2D snake game where the user controls a "snake" and 
		attempts to eat as much food as possible to gain points. 
		See 2.1 for instruction to the game.
	
	1.2 .cardTrick A card trick in which the user picks a card 
		out of a set of twenty-one cards and the computer "guesses" the 
		users card based on 3 questions. See 2.2 for game instructions.
	
	1.3 .euclidsAlgorithm Euclid's Algorithm is a mathematical algorithm 
		that determines the highest common factor of two positive 
		integers. See 2.3 for execution instructions.
		
2. The instructions to each self contained project are as follows;
	
	2.1 .snake Instructions
	
		2.1.1 Run .snake.Game.java and a window will open.
		
		2.1.2 Using the arrow keys to direct the snake around the 
			arena. If the snake's head collides with the wall or 
			the snakes body the game will end.
			
		2.1.3 The aim of the game is to intercept as many pieces 
			of "food" as possible.
	
	2.2. .cardTrick Instructions
		
		2.2.1 Run .cardTrick.CardTrick.java and the program will
			run in the console.
			
		2.2.2 The program will ask the user to pick a "card" out 
			of a random set of cards. The user should hold there 
			selected card in their memory until the end.
			
		2.2.3 The program will ask the user which coloumn their 
			card is in. The user should input either 1, 2 or 3 
			denoting which coloumn it is in.
			
		2.2.4 After the 3 questions the program will correctly guess 
			the users card.

	2.3 .euclidsAlgorithm Instructions
		
		2.3.1 Run .euclidsAlgorithm.EuclidsAlgorithm.java and the 
		program will run in the console.
		
		2.3.2 Follow the program instructions to get the HCF(a,b).
		
		2.3.3 The user can execute the extended euclidian algorithm 
			which gives m and n such that ma + nb = HCF(a,b).
