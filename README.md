# Showcase
A showcase of the ability of Joshua Eddy. Projects contained within were either developed 
solely or in part by him.

There are two projects in this repository the first is Finance_Handler, this project is C# 
and is a basic budgeting system currently in use by Joshua Eddy to budget his university 
funds. The system allows the user to create a local SQLite file and use it to store the
flow of their money. The system is self-explanatory.

The second project is JavaExamples, this project is Java and contains a set of Java 
applications that range from a card trick to 3D snake. Each of these applications is 
in their own separate packages inside the same project for easy access. Inside each package, 
there is a class that contains the main method that will run that class's game.
